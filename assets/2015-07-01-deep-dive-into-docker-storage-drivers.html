# What's Docker?

- A *platform* made of the *Docker Engine* and the *Docker Hub*

- The *Docker Engine* is a runtime for containers

- It's Open Source, and written in Go 
  <br/> .small[.small[ http://www.slideshare.net/jpetazzo/docker-and-go-why-did-we-decide-to-write-docker-in-go ]]

- It's a daemon, controlled by a REST.gray[-ish] API

# What happened here?

- We created a *container* (~lightweight virtual machine),
  <br/> with its own:

  - filesystem (based initially on a `python` image)
  - network stack
  - process space

- We started with a `bash` process
  <br/> (no `init`, no `systemd`, no problem)

- We installed IPython with pip, and ran it

---

# What did .underline[not] happen here?

- We did not make a full copy of the `python` image

The installation was done in the *container*, not the *image*:

- We did not modify the `python` image itself

- We did not affect any other container
  <br/> (currently using this image or any other image)

---

# How is this important?

- We used a *copy-on-write* mechanism
  <br/> (Well, Docker took care of it for us)

- Instead of making a full copy of the `python` image,
  keep track of changes between this image and our container

- Huge disk space savings (1 container = less than 1 MB)

- Huge time savings (1 container = less than 0.1s to start)

---

class: center, middle

# Copy-on-write

---

# What is copy-on-write?

*It's a mechanism allowing to share data.*

*The data appears to be a copy, but is only
a link (or reference) to the original data.*

*The actual copy happens only when someone
tries to change the shared data.*

*Whoever changes the shared data ends up
sharing their own copy instead.*

---

# A few metaphors

--

- First metaphor:
  <br/>white board and tracing paper

--

- Second metaphor:
  <br/>magic books with shadowy pages

--

- Third metaphor:
  <br/>just-in-time house building

---

# Copy-on-write is *everywhere*

- Process creation with `fork()`

- Consistent disk snapshots

- Efficient VM provisioning

- CONTAINERS
  <br/>(building, shipping, running thereof)

---

# Process creation

- On virtually all UNIX systems,
  <br/>the only way.red[*] to create a new process
  <br/>is by making a copy of an existing process

- This has to be fast
  <br/>(even if the process uses many GBs of RAM)

- See `fork()` and `clone()` system calls

.footnote[.red[*] Except for the first process (PID 1)]

---

# Memory snapshots

- Example: Redis `SAVE` command

- Achieves *consistent* snapshot

- Implementation relies on `fork()`

- One "copy" continues to serve requests,
  <br/>the other writes memory to disk and exits

---

# Mapped memory

- Load a file in memory instantaneously!
  <br/>(even if it's huge and doesn't fit in RAM)

- Data is loaded on demand from disk

- Writes to memory can be:

  - visible just by us (copy-on-write)
  
  - committed to disk

See: `mmap()`

---

# How does it work?

--

![Magic!](http://media.giphy.com/media/ujUdrdpX7Ok5W/giphy.gif)

---

# How does it work?

- Thanks to the MMU! (Memory Management Unit)

- Each memory access goes through it

- Translates memory accesses (location.red[¹] + operation.red[²]) into:

  - actual physical location

  - or, alternatively, a *page fault*

.footnote[
.red[¹] Location = address = pointer

.red[²] Operation = read, write, or exec
]

---

# Memory behaviors

- Read to private data = OK

- Read to shared data = OK

- Write to private data = OK

- Write to shared data = *page fault*

  - the MMU notifies the OS

  - the OS makes a copy of the shared data

  - the OS informs the MMU that the copy is private

  - the write operation resumes as if nothing happened

---

# Other scenarios

- Access to non-existent memory area = `SIGSEGV`/`SIGBUS`
  <br/>.small[(a.k.a. "Segmentation fault"/"Bus error" a.k.a. "Go and learn to use pointers")]

- Access to swapped-out memory area = load it from disk
  <br/>.small[(a.k.a. "My program is now 1000x slower")]

- Write attempt to code area / exec attempt to non-code area:
  <br/>kill the process (sometimes)
  <br/>.small[(prevents some attacks, but also messes with JIT compilers)]

Note: one "page" is typically 4 KB.

---

# Consistent disk snapshots

- "I want to make a backup of a busy database"

  - I don't want to stop the database during the backup

  - the backup must be *consistent* (single point in time)

- Initially available (I think) on external storage (NAS, SAN),
  <br/>because/therefore:

  - it's complicated

  - it's expensive

---

# Thin provisioning for VMs.red[¹]

- Put system image on copy-on-write storage

- For each machine.red[¹], create copy-on-write instance

- If the system image contains a lot of useful software,
  people will almost never need to install extra stuff

- Each extra machine will only need disk space for data!

WIN $$$ (And performance, too, because of caching)

.footnote[.small[.red[¹] Not only VMs, but also physical machines with netboot, and containers!]]

---

# Copy-on-write spreads everywhere

(In no specific order; non-exhaustive list)

- LVM (Logical Volume Manager) on Linux

- ZFS on Solaris, then FreeBSD, Linux ...

- BTRFS on Linux

- AUFS, UnionMount, overlay.gray[fs] ...

- Virtual disks in VM hypervisors
  <br/>(qcow, qcow2, VirtualBox/VMware equivalents, EBS...)

---

# Copy-on-write and Docker: a love story

- Without copy-on-write...

  - it would take forever to start a container

  - containers would use up a lot of space

- Without copy-on-write "on your desktop"...

  - Docker would not be usable on your Linux machine

  - There would be no Docker at all.
    <br/>And no meet-up here tonight.
    <br/>And we would all be shaving yaks instead.

# History of Docker storage drivers

---

# First came AUFS

- Docker used to be dotCloud
  <br/>(PaaS, like Heroku, Cloud Foundry, OpenShift...)

- dotCloud started using AUFS in 2008
  <br/>(with vserver, then OpenVZ, then LXC)

- Great fit for high density, PaaS applications
  <br/>(More on this later!)

---

# AUFS is not perfect

- Not in mainline kernel

- Applying the patches used to be *exciting*

- ... especially in combination with GRSEC

- ... and other custom fancery like `setns()`

---

# But some people believe in AUFS!

- dotCloud, obviously

- Debian and Ubuntu use it in their default kernels,
  <br/>for Live CD and similar use cases:

  - Your root filesystem is a copy-on-write between
    <br/>- the read-only media (CD, DVD...) 
    <br/>- and a read-write media (disk, USB stick...)

- As it happens, we also .red[♥] Debian and Ubuntu very much

- First version of Docker is targeted at Ubuntu (and Debian)

---

# Then, some people started to believe in Docker

- Red Hat users *demanded* Docker on their favorite distro

- Red Hat Inc. wanted to make it happen

- ... and contributed support for the Device Mapper driver

- ... then the BTRFS driver

- ... then the overlay.gray[fs] driver


.footnote[Note: other contributors also helped tremendously!]

# Let's see each

# storage driver

# in action

---

class: center, middle

# AUFS

---

# In Theory

- Combine multiple *branches* in a specific order

- Each branch is just a normal directory

- You generally have:

  - at least one read-only branch (at the bottom)

  - exactly one read-write branch (at the top)

  (But other fun combinations are possible too!)

---

# When opening a file...

- With `O_RDONLY` - read-only access:

  - look it up in each branch, starting from the top

  - open the first one we find

- With `O_WRONLY` or `O_RDWR` - write access:

  - look it up in the top branch;
    <br/>if it's found here, open it

  - otherwise, look it up in the other branches;
    <br/>if we find it, copy it to the read-write (top) branch,
    <br/>then open the copy

.footnote[That "copy-up" operation can take a while if the file is big!]

---

# When deleting a file...

- A *whiteout* file is created
  <br/>(if you know the concept of "tombstones", this is similar)

.small[
```
# docker run ubuntu rm /etc/shadow

# ls -la /var/lib/docker/aufs/diff/$(docker ps --no-trunc -lq)/etc
total 8

```

# In Practice

- The AUFS mountpoint for a container is
  <br/>`/var/lib/docker/aufs/mnt/$CONTAINER_ID/`

- It is only mounted when the container is *running*

- The AUFS branches (read-only and read-write) are in
  <br/>`/var/lib/docker/aufs/diff/$CONTAINER_OR_IMAGE_ID/`

- All writes go to `/var/lib/docker`

```
dockerhost# df -h /var/lib/docker
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/xvdb        15G  4.8G  9.5G  34% /mnt
```

---

# Under the hood

- To see details about an AUFS mount:

  - look for its internal ID in `/proc/mounts`

  - look in `/sys/fs/aufs/si_.../br*`

  - each branch (except the two top ones)
  <br/>translates to an image

---

# Example

.small[
```
dockerhost# grep c7af /proc/mounts
none /mnt/.../c7af...a63d aufs rw,relatime,si=2344a8ac4c6c6e55 0 0

# Performance, tuning

- AUFS `mount()` is fast, so creation of containers is quick

- Read/write access has native speeds

- But initial `open()` is expensive in two scenarios:

  - when writing big files (log files, databases ...)

  - with many layers + many directories in `PATH`
    <br/>(dynamic loading, anyone?)

- Protip: when we built dotCloud, we ended up putting
  all important data on *volumes*

- When starting the same container 1000x, the data is loaded
  only once from disk, and cached only once in memory
  (but `dentries` will be duplicated)

---

# Device Mapper

---

# Preamble

- Device Mapper is a complex subsystem; it can do:

  - RAID

  - encrypted devices

  - snapshots (i.e. copy-on-write)

  - and some other niceties

- In the context of Docker, "Device Mapper" means
  <br/>"the Device Mapper system + its *thin provisioning target*"
  <br/>(sometimes noted "thinp")

---

# In theory

- Copy-on-write happens on the *block* level
  <br/>(instead of the *file* level)

- Each container and each image gets its own block device

- At any given time, it is possible to take a snapshot:

  - of an existing container (to create a frozen image)

  - of an existing image (to create a container from it)

- If a block has never been written to:

  - it's assumed to be all zeros

  - it's not allocated on disk
  <br/>(hence "thin" provisioning)

---

# In practice

- The mountpoint for a container is
  <br/>`/var/lib/docker/devicemapper/mnt/$CONTAINER_ID/`

- It is only mounted when the container is *running*

- The data is stored in two files, "data" and "metadata"
  <br/>(More on this later)

- Since we are working on the block level, there is not much
  visibility on the diffs between images and containers

---

# Under the hood

- `docker info` will tell you about the state of the pool
  <br/>(used/available space)

- List devices with `dmsetup ls`

- Device names are prefixed with `docker-MAJ:MIN-INO`

  .small[MAJ, MIN, and INO are derived from the block major,
  block minor, and inode number where the Docker data is
  located (to avoid conflict when running multiple Docker
  instances, e.g. with Docker-in-Docker)]

- Get more info about them with `dmsetup info`, `dmsetup status`
  <br/>(you shouldn't need this, unless the system is badly borked)

- Snapshots have an internal numeric ID

- `/var/lib/docker/devicemapper/metadata/$CONTAINER_OR_IMAGE_ID`
  <br/>is a small JSON file tracking the snapshot ID and its size

---

<!-- # Example -->

# Extra details

- Two storage areas are needed:
  <br/>one for *data*, another for *metadata*

- "data" is also called the "pool"; it's just a big pool of blocks
  <br/>(Docker uses the smallest possible block size, 64 KB)

- "metadata" contains the mappings between virtual offsets (in the
  snapshots) and physical offsets (in the pool)

- Each time a new block (or a copy-on-write block) is written,
  a block is allocated from the pool

- When there are no more blocks in the pool, attempts to write
  will stall until the pool is increased (or the write operation
  aborted)

---

# Performance

- By default, Docker puts data and metadata on a loop device
  backed by a sparse file

- This is great from a usability point of view
  <br/>(zero configuration needed)

- But terrible from a performance point of view:

  - each time a container writes to a new block,
  - a block has to be allocated from the pool,
  - and when it's written to,
  - a block has to be allocated from the sparse file,
  - and sparse file performance isn't great anyway

---

# Tuning

- Do yourself a favor: if you use Device Mapper,
  <br/>put data (and metadata) on real devices!

  - stop Docker

  - change parameters

  - wipe out `/var/lib/docker` (important!)

  - restart Docker

.small[
```
docker -d --storage-opt dm.datadev=/dev/sdb1 --storage-opt dm.metadatadev=/dev/sdc1
```
]

---

# More tuning

- Each container gets its own block device

  - with a real FS on it

- So you can also adjust (with `--storage-opt`):

  - filesystem type

  - filesystem size

  - `discard` (more on this later)

- Caveat: when you start 1000x containers,
  <br/>the files will be loaded 1000x from disk!

# BTRFS

---

# In theory

- Do the whole "copy-on-write" thing at the filesystem level

- Create.red[¹] a "subvolume" (imagine `mkdir` with Super Powers)

- Snapshot.red[¹] any subvolume at any given time

- BTRFS integrates the snapshot and block pool management features
  at the filesystem level, instead of the block device level

.footnote[.red[¹] This can be done with the `btrfs` tool.]  

---

# In practice

- `/var/lib/docker` has to be on a BTRFS filesystem!

- The BTRFS mountpoint for a container or an image is
  <br/>`/var/lib/docker/btrfs/subvolumes/$CONTAINER_OR_IMAGE_ID/`

- It should be present even if the container is not running

- Data is not written directly, it goes to the journal first
  <br/>(in some circumstances.red[¹], this will affect performance)

.footnote[.red[¹] E.g. uninterrupted streams of writes.
<br/>The performance will be half of the "native" performance.]

---

# Under the hood

- BTRFS works by dividing its storage in *chunks*

- A chunk can contain data or metadata

- You can run out of chunks (and get `No space left on device`)
  <br/>even though `df` shows space available
  <br/>(because the chunks are not full)

- Quick fix:

```
# btrfs filesys balance start -dusage=1 /var/lib/docker
```

---

<!-- # Example -->

# Performance, tuning

- Not much to tune

- Keep an eye on the output of `btrfs filesys show`!

This filesystem is doing fine:

.small[
```
# btrfs filesys show
Label: none  uuid: 80b37641-4f4a-4694-968b-39b85c67b934
        Total devices 1 FS bytes used 4.20GiB
        devid    1 size 15.25GiB used 6.04GiB path /dev/xvdc
```
]

This one, however, is full (no free chunk) even though there
is not that much data on it:

.small[
```
# btrfs filesys show
Label: none  uuid: de060d4c-99b6-4da0-90fa-fb47166db38b
        Total devices 1 FS bytes used 2.51GiB
        devid    1 size 87.50GiB used 87.50GiB path /dev/xvdc
```

# Overlay.gray[fs]

---

# Preamble

What with the grayed .gray[fs]?

- It used to be called (and have filesystem type) `overlayfs`

- When it was merged in 3.18, this was changed to `overlay`

---

# In theory

- This is just like AUFS, with minor differences:

  - only two branches (called "layers")

  - but branches can be overlays themselves

---

# In practice

- You need kernel 3.18

- On Ubuntu.red[¹]:

  - go to http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/

  - locate the most recent directory, e.g. `v3.18.4-vidi`

  - download the `linux-image-..._amd64.deb` file

  - `dpkg -i` that file, reboot, enjoy

.footnote[.red[¹]
Adaptation to other distros left as an exercise for the reader.
]

---

# Under the hood

- Images and containers are materialized under
  <br/>`/var/lib/docker/overlay/$ID_OF_CONTAINER_OR_IMAGE`

- Images just have a `root` subdirectory
  <br/>(containing the root FS)

- Containers have:

  - `lower-id` → file containing the ID of the image

  - `merged/` → mount point for the container .small[(when running)]

  - `upper/` → read-write layer for the container

  - `work/` → temporary space used for atomic copy-up

---

<!-- # Example -->

# Performance, tuning

- Implementation detail:
  <br/>identical files are hardlinked between images
  <br/>(this avoids doing composed overlays)

- Not much to tune at this point

- Performance should be slightly better than AUFS:

  - no `stat()` explosion

  - good memory use

  - slow copy-up, still (nobody's perfect)

---

class: center, middle

# VFS

---

# In theory

- No copy on write. Docker does a full copy each time!

- Doesn't rely on those fancy-pesky kernel features

- Good candidate when porting Docker to new platforms
  <br/>(think FreeBSD, Solaris...)

- Space .underline[in]efficient, slow

---

# In practice

- Might be useful for production setups

  (If you don't want / cannot use volumes, and don't want / cannot
  use any of the copy-on-write mechanisms!)

# ZFS

---

class: middle, center

![ZFS on Docker by @solarce](zfs.png)

---

# In theory

- Similar to BTRFS

- Fast snapshot, fast creation, fast snapshot...

- Epic performance and reliability (YMMV)

- ZFS has the reputation to be quite Memory hungry
  <br/>(=you probably don't want that in a tiny VM)

---

# In practice

- Obviously you need to setup ZFS yourself

- *Should* be compatible with all flavors
  <br/>(kernel-based and FUSE)

---

# Under the hood

- Shells out to `zfs-utils`

- Why not `libzfs`?
  <br/>Because it's tied to a specific kernel version

# Conclusions

*The nice thing about Docker storage drivers,
<br/>is that there are so many of them to choose from.*

# What do, what do?

- If you do PaaS or other high-density environment:

  - AUFS (if available on your kernel)

  - overlayfs (otherwise)

- If you put big writable files on the CoW filesystem:

  - BTRFS, ZFS, or Device Mapper (pick the one you know best)

# Bonus track

## `discard` and `TRIM`

---

# `TRIM`

- Command sent to a SSD disk, to tell it:
  <br/>*"that block is not in use anymore"*

- Useful because on SSD, *erase* is very expensive (slow)

- Allows the SSD to pre-erase cells in advance
  <br/>(rather than on-the-fly, just before a *write*)

- Also meaningful on copy-on-write storage
  <br/>(if/when every snapshots as trimmed a block, it can be freed)

---

# `discard`

- Filesystem option meaning:
  <br/>*"can I has `TRIM` on this pls"*

- Can be enabled/disabled at any time

- Filesystem can also be trimmed manually with `fstrim`
  <br/>(even while mounted)

---

# The `discard` quandary

- `discard` works on Device Mapper + loopback devices

- ... but is particularly slow on loopback devices
  <br/>(the loopback file needs to be "re-sparsified"
  after container or image deletion, and this is a slow
  operation)

- You can turn it on or off depending on your preference
